# HackXX-WIS
Goal: Encourage women in UCSD to be more involved in STEM. 
What We Need: Data of some possible mentors/ mentees. 
Plan: Create a webpage using a database that holds all the information 
about different women in STEM. Matching mentees with mentors or allowing
students to find a mentor at UCSD.
